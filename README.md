**AI driven Plant Disease detection in Intel oneapi** :
                                        The major concern in agriculture is food insecurity and labour-intensive tasks. The appearance of newer plant diseases can lead to severely low crop output and farm incomes. This can be solved by using our plant predictive model. This  project is mainly focused on creating a impact on agriculture sector by implementing the software that helps to detect the disease in plants known as plant  disease prediction and give suggestion based on the diseasse and recommend the treatments for the plant.
                
**Introduction**           
             Our software works very easy and efficient way , just the user can take photos of the affected plants and upload to our web or app services and then the model predict the affected part of the leaf and identify the disease with almost greater precision rates . The affected disease is classified and tell the farmer suggestive and recommend ways that a plant can be cured . The same procedure ways for the seed detection .
                
**Software work**       
                We are implementing the project by using one of the deep learning models called convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and one of the popular architecture available on cnn model and has better accuracy rates, namely Resnet, which has 99.98% accuracy.   The front end of the website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the cloud services . The image is upload in our app will send the image to the image preprocessing stage, where the image is resized and preprocessed , and then the data is split into two types: training and testing data.We use data from The Kaggle dataset , which has  87K RGB pictures of healthy and damaged crop leaves. . The model performance is analyzed through some of the methods, such as F1-score,recall.Then the model is deployed through cloud-based services.Our model can classify images better than other models with a greater number of accuracy .Then the model is deployed through cloud-based services.Our model can classify images better than other models with a greater number of accuracy . 
                
                
**Impact and Changes**  
                This can bring positive changes to agriculture by introducing more sustainable practices and gaining more knowledge about disease, which can be prevented in future times. Our software can be used in real-time identification of disease in agriculture. It also helps the researchers to know more about the diseases. This can bring  changes to mainly farmers and researchers. The farmer can identify the disease and provide immediate help to the plants, which can promote good quality of crop yield. Farmers, stakeholders, researchers, and agronomists practice and manage agriculture, including crop production, soil management, and high-quality seed selection. This software can be implemented using a deep learning framework such as Python. 


**Challenges and Future Works**          
                The challenges include High-quality and diverse datasets are required to train a detection model and effectively classify diseases. The model may struggle with differences in seed appearance induced by different lighting conditions or image quality. and needed continuous model updates. The project can improve crop productivity, increase farm products, and solve the disease by practicing more organic methods rather than using pesticides, which indirectly affect soil health. The future work involves importing a larger dataset for seed detection and for continuous learning and regular updates to the model based on new data and Add forums and chat support to help users get the most out of the application.Â
